                <p>Kia orana and hello! I'm George Joseph but please call me Joey. I am a full-stack developer and tech educator specializing in the MERN stack. I come from a background in management, counseling and education, and this greatly informs my approach to programming and teamwork. My skills include Mongo, Express, React and Node, as well as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and GraphQL. I am a veritable whiz with Github, Heroku and Netlify, and have experience working with Agile.</p>
                <p>I was born and raised in New Zealand, and my family lives in the Cook Islands, where we are from. I hold dual citizenship in both the United States and New Zealand, and have the right to work in both countries. I am currently located in beautiful Tucson, AZ. When I am not coding, I can be found cooking delicious meals, working with plants, or writing creative non-fiction for my Medium blog.</p>
